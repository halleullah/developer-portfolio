            <h2>Know about gameplay</h2>
            <p>Valorant is a team-based first-person hero shooter set in the near future. Players play as one of a set
                of agents, characters designed based on several countries and cultures around the world. In the main
                game mode, players are assigned to either the attacking or defending team with each team having five
                players on it.

                <h2 class="vw">2021-Present | Reduced The Running Accuracy
                </h2>
                <p>Since launch, run-and-gun has been a hot topic. While we believe that there are certain situations
                    that
                    moving and shooting should be powerful, it is currently more potent than we’d like. This patch
                    targets a
                    piece of the puzzle that we haven’t touched before which is what we call “tag into accuracy.”

                <h1>AGENT UPDATES
                </h1>
                <h2 class="vw">2021-Present | Agents Got Nerfed</h2>
                <p>To hit our goal of creating a more dynamic sandbox, we have adjusted ability pricing, cooldown rates,
                    and
                    ultimate costs on every Agent. Generally, we noticed that certain agents were able to have too much
                    impact with their abilities without making any significant tradeoffs. Our goal here is to create a
                    healthier pace of abilities throughout a round and force you to think more critically about your
                    purchase decisions. </p>
